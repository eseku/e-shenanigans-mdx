## Bummer.

Well everyone knows we might just you know, not exist anymore because of as the Ghanaian tv presenter would put it, "The Novel Coronavirus"
I don't even want to dwell so deep into it cos it's not to be named. School's canceled and all. Maybe I might be a little bit happy because of that ðŸ˜‚,
but yeah in essence Corona is not a good thing.

Forgive me for going off topic

Well As you saw from the title of the blog post, this is to showcase a covid19 app i made. This app was not / is not for sale or anything. A friend asked me to
do it and yeah.
So this was the dribble shot i was supposed to mockup

This was going to be mainly focused on the data. Good and free data is not _THAT_ easy to come by.
Anyways these are my screenshots from my covid19 which is never going to get deployed Anyways
