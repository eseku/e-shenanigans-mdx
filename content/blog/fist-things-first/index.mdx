   Until recently I could have sworn software development was  such a headache and my second biggest pain in the ass, succeeding calculus whose spot is tight and secured. 
   My 2018 summer internship at some firm exposed me to a whole lot about development as a whole and all i am left with is a buzzing and rapidly growing interest to learn and grow as a software engineer. 
   2019 was a year of growth to me and 2020 is going to be even better.

  I am going to be posting my thoughts on different technologies and libraries here.
